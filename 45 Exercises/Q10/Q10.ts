// 10. Adding Comments:
// Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t
// have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name
// and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the
// program does.


//program 1:

const num1: number = 5;
const num2: number = 3;
const sum: number = num1 + num2;

console.log(`The sum of ${num1} and ${num2} is: ${sum}`);


//program 2:

const favouriteNumber: number = 7;

console.log(`My favorite number is: ${favouriteNumber}`);
