// 10. Adding Comments:
// Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t
// have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name
// and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the
// program does.
//program 1:
const num1 = 5;
const num2 = 3;
const sum = num1 + num2;
console.log(`The sum of ${num1} and ${num2} is: ${sum}`);
//program 2:
const favouriteNumber = 7;
console.log(`My favorite number is: ${favouriteNumber}`);
