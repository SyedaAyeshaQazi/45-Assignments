// 12. Greetings:
// Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name,
// print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be
// personalized with the person’s name.

    console.log(`Hello! ${guestsnames} you are invited for dinner`);
